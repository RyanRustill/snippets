A collection of programming stuff I've been working on. Each project is something I thought was cool enough to save and share.

Everything here actually runs and has instructions if you want to try it yourself.

## [üêç Spiral Galaxy Generator](python/spirals) `Python` `turtle`
**Just figured out how to create galaxy-like spirals with Python's turtle graphics**

The math behind this blew my mind - just two simple variables create this incredible expanding spiral pattern. Takes about 30 seconds to watch it draw itself.

## [üåà Rainbow Spiral Generator](python/rainbow_spiral) `Python` `turtle` `color`
**Figured out how to make spirals that cycle through every color in the rainbow using math**

This was my first time combining color theory with programming! I discovered you can use trigonometric functions to calculate smooth color transitions. The same spiral pattern as before, but now it flows through the entire color spectrum.

## [üå™Ô∏è Canvas Spiral](javascript/spirals) `JavaScript` `Canvas`
**Same spiral pattern but in the browser with real-time animation**

This one's cool because you can watch it being drawn in real-time. Same math as the Python version but using HTML5 canvas instead of turtle graphics.

## [üü® Neon Cube Animation](javascript/neon_cube) `JavaScript` `Canvas`
**Built this cube that draws itself line-by-line with glowing neon effects**

Pure HTML5 canvas and JavaScript - no frameworks needed. The cube appears stroke by stroke and then pulses with this cool glow effect before starting over.

## [‚öΩ Bouncing Ball Physics](javascript/bouncing_ball) `JavaScript` `Physics`
**Figured out how to make things bounce realistically with actual gravity and physics**

This was my first time programming real physics! The balls bounce with gravity, lose energy when they hit walls, and you can click to add more. Way cooler than I expected physics programming to be.

## [üé® ASCII Pattern Generator](c/ascii_patterns) `C` `Mathematics`
**Turning math equations into visual art using nothing but text characters**

Four different mathematical patterns including the famous Mandelbrot fractal set! Going from basic C programs to generating complex mathematical visualizations feels incredible. Each pattern uses different math concepts like complex numbers and polar coordinates.
