A collection of programming stuff I've been working on. Each project is something I thought was cool enough to save and share.

Everything here actually runs and has instructions if you want to try it yourself.

## [🐍 Spiral Galaxy Generator](python/spirals) `Python` `turtle`
**Just figured out how to create galaxy-like spirals with Python's turtle graphics**

The math behind this blew my mind - just two simple variables create this incredible expanding spiral pattern. Takes about 30 seconds to watch it draw itself.

## [🌪️ Canvas Spiral](javascript/spirals) `JavaScript` `Canvas`
**Same spiral pattern but in the browser with real-time animation**

This one's cool because you can watch it being drawn in real-time. Same math as the Python version but using HTML5 canvas instead of turtle graphics.

## [🟨 Neon Cube Animation](javascript/neon_cube) `JavaScript` `Canvas`
**Built this cube that draws itself line-by-line with glowing neon effects**

Pure HTML5 canvas and JavaScript - no frameworks needed. The cube appears stroke by stroke and then pulses with this cool glow effect before starting over.
