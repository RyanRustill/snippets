A collection of programming stuff I've been working on. Each project is something I thought was cool enough to save and share.

Everything here actually runs and has instructions if you want to try it yourself.

## [🐍 Spiral Galaxy Generator](python/spirals) `Python` `turtle`
**Just figured out how to create galaxy-like spirals with Python's turtle graphics**

The math behind this blew my mind - just two simple variables create this incredible expanding spiral pattern. Takes about 30 seconds to watch it draw itself.

## [🌈 Rainbow Spiral Generator](python/rainbow_spiral) `Python` `turtle` `color`
**Figured out how to make spirals that cycle through every color in the rainbow using math**

This was my first time combining color theory with programming! I discovered you can use trigonometric functions to calculate smooth color transitions. The same spiral pattern as before, but now it flows through the entire color spectrum.

## [🌪️ Canvas Spiral](javascript/spirals) `JavaScript` `Canvas`
**Same spiral pattern but in the browser with real-time animation**

This one's cool because you can watch it being drawn in real-time. Same math as the Python version but using HTML5 canvas instead of turtle graphics.

## [🟨 Neon Cube Animation](javascript/neon_cube) `JavaScript` `Canvas`
**Built this cube that draws itself line-by-line with glowing neon effects**

Pure HTML5 canvas and JavaScript - no frameworks needed. The cube appears stroke by stroke and then pulses with this cool glow effect before starting over.

## [⚽ Bouncing Ball Physics](javascript/bouncing_ball) `JavaScript` `Physics`
**Figured out how to make things bounce realistically with actual gravity and physics**

This was my first time programming real physics! The balls bounce with gravity, lose energy when they hit walls, and you can click to add more. Way cooler than I expected physics programming to be.

## [🌧️ Digital Rain Animation](javascript/digital_rain) `JavaScript` `Particles`
**Matrix-style falling code rain with Japanese characters and interactive effects**

My first real particle system! Green characters fall like in The Matrix, with realistic trailing effects and interactive features. Click anywhere to create burst effects, or press 'N' for Neo mode. Learning about alpha compositing and performance optimization was amazing.

## [🎨 ASCII Pattern Generator](c/ascii_patterns) `C` `Mathematics`
**Turning math equations into visual art using nothing but text characters**

Four different mathematical patterns including the famous Mandelbrot fractal set! Going from basic C programs to generating complex mathematical visualizations feels incredible. Each pattern uses different math concepts like complex numbers and polar coordinates.
